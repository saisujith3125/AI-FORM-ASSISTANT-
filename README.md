2. **API Keys:** 
    - **OpenAI API key** (Required)
    - **ElevenLabs API key** (Optional)
    - **Spotify API key** (Optional)

### ‚ö° Quickstart
*(For the steps requiring the terminal, it's best to use either the **Command Prompt** or **Git Bash**)*
1. **Clone the github repository:** You can either download this reporsitory in a zip folder or clone it with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/daerese/stella-gpt
```
2. **Start a virtual environment** (optional): If you do not want to to install the packages for this program directly on your machine, then you can use a virtual environment.

*First, confirm that the package **virtualenv** is installed. If not, then install it with this command:*
```
pip install virtualenv
```
*Create the virtual environment:*
```
 python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```
*OR you can create it with this command:*
```
virtualenv <virtual-environment-name>
```

*Activate the virual environment:*
- *If you are using the **Git Bash:***
```
source <virtual-environment-name>/Scripts/activate
```
- *If you are using the **Command Prompt:***
```
<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate
```


3. **Install the required python packages:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### üîë Setting your API Keys
*Your API keys will be read from a ".env" file.*
1. **In the root directory, create a file called ".env"**
2. **In the file, use the following variables to store your API keys**
```.env
OPENAI_API_KEY = "Your API key"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "Your API key"
```
3. If you don't have these API keys you need to create an account with these websites:
    -  [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) --> Click on your profile, then navigate to **View API Keys** and create one.
    - [ElevenLabs API](https://elevenlabs.io/)  --> Navigate to **Profile** to view your API key
#### üìª Spotify API usage (optional)
*To obtain required information for Spotify interactivity, you need to create a project on the **[Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/)** website.*

*You will need **two terminals**. One for the main program, and one for the Flask server (this is used to retrieve the text-to-speech audio created from ChatGPT's responses)*
1. **Ensure that the virtual environment is active in both terminals. If not activate it with the command:**
```
<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate
```
2. **Run the flask server in one terminal**
```
python flask_server.py
```
3. **Run the main program in the other terminal**
```
python main.py
```
